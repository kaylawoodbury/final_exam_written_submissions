Adding a well scoped feature to a projects must include the team or person working on the feature to determine the user story they are attempting to solve. Along with that, the individual tasks to accomplish that goal should also be laid out so that as you move through the feature you ensure that you stay in scope and on target for the main goal of the feature. 

Once the planning is done for a feature, create a branch from the default branch that is clearly named to describe the user story the feature is answering. Each feature should begin with establishing tests that will help guide you through the implementation as well as help you be more efficient. Commits should be frequent and often with clear consie descriptions of the actions taken since the previous commit. A good rule of thumb is to commit each time you can make a test go green. 

While tasks may change during the process, they will also help mark when you are done with a feature. Once done, make sure all tests go greem. Do a dry run of the application. And create a descriptive PR that explains what is added with the feature.
